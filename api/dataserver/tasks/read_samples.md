# Read Samples

Samples may be read by a Client acting on behalf of:

1. the owner of Samples, or
1. an Agent of the owners of Samples.

The procedure for reading Samples the owner or an Agent differs only by the inclusion of an AgencyQueryToken.

Reading Samples is a two-staged process:

1. Perform a query, creating a snapshot of query results on the DataServer, returning metadata about the results.
1. Read query results.

## Step 1: Perform a Query

```
POST DATASERVER/api/query
```

* `DATASERVER` is the base URL for the [DataServer](../../../environment.md)
