# CorrelationSamples

A CorrelationSample groups nutritional or blood pressure QuantitySamples.

## Important Note

TL;DR: You need to have scope, and request TypeIdentifiers for Correlation and Quantity.

The relationship between CorrelationSamples and QuantitySamples that is important to consider when:

* Requesting scope
* Using the [DataServer API](../index.md)

When reading or writing Quantity Samples that are correlated (are grouped by a parent Correlation Sample), a request must:

* contain appropriate scope for Quantities _and_ Correlations
* contain TypeIdentifiers for Quantities _and_ Correlations

### Example

A Client that writes systolic and diastolic blood pressure data to the DataServer should:

1. Be configured to request the scopes
	* write.blood_pressure
	* write.blood_pressure.blood_pressure_systolic
	* write.blood_pressure.blood_pressure_diastolic
1. When writing data, construct:
	* a Correlation SampleData of TypeIdentifier "blood_pressure"
	* two child Quantity SampleData of TypeIdentifiers "blood_pressure_systolic" and "blood_pressure_diastolic"

### Example

A Client that reads iron ingestion from the DataServer should:

1. Be configured to request the scopes
	* read.food
	* read.food.dietary_iron
1. When reading data, deconstruct:
	* a Correlation SampleData of TypeIdentifier "food"
	* a child Quantity SampleData of TypeIdentifiers "dietary_iron" 



## TypeIdentifier and Scope

Scope is TypeIdentifier prefixed with `read.` or `write.`.
